# Cross-Episode Consistency Analysis

Human directive: エピソード間の整合性も考察したい

## Idea

Create a cross-episode analysis page that compares parameters across episodes:

- Ship mass assumptions: ep01 concludes ~299t boundary, ep03 concludes ~452t boundary — are these consistent?
- Thrust specifications: 9.8 MN used across all episodes
- Orbital mechanics assumptions: do departure/arrival conditions chain properly?
  - ep01: Mars → Ganymede (Jupiter system)
  - ep02: Jupiter escape → Saturn/Enceladus
  - ep03: Enceladus → Titania (Uranus system)
- Speed/velocity consistency across episodes

## Implementation

- Could be a separate report page (not episode-specific)
- Compare key parameters in a summary table
- Highlight discrepancies and discuss implications
- Link to individual episode analyses for details

## Priority

Medium — this builds on completed episode analyses (ep01-03 done).
Should be created as a task when episode 4 analysis begins or after.

## Status: RESOLVED

Implemented as Task 021. Cross-episode consistency analysis page published at summary/cross-episode.html. Extensively expanded through Tasks 263, 264, 265, 273, 282.
