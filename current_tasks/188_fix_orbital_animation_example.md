# Task 188: Fix Orbital Animation Example Page and Harden E2E Tests

## Status: IN_PROGRESS

## Goal

The standalone orbital animation example page (`ts/examples/orbital-animation.html`) has a stale selector. The page uses `<text data-animation-config>` to embed animation data, but `orbital-animation.js` looks for `.orbital-animation-data` (a class-based selector on a `<script>` element). This means the example page's animation is non-functional — the JS silently returns when it can't find the data element.

Additionally, the existing E2E test for this example page (`ts/e2e/examples.spec.ts`) only checks that the SVG renders and `data-animated="true"` is present, but does NOT verify that the ship marker actually moves.

## Tasks

1. Fix the animation data element in `orbital-animation.html` to use the correct selector pattern (`.orbital-animation-data` class on a `<script type="application/json">` element)
2. Add/update E2E test in `examples.spec.ts` to verify that animation actually plays (ship marker position changes after play)
3. Verify all tests pass

## Context

- Task 131 added unit tests for arrival alignment, but the example page was never updated to match the new selector pattern
- The real report pages use `<script type="application/json" class="orbital-animation-data">` (generated by templates.ts)
- The JS (`orbital-animation.js` line 134) queries `card.querySelector(".orbital-animation-data")`
