# Task 192: EP04 Counterfactual IF Analyses

Status: DONE

## Goal

Add counterfactual IF analyses to EP04 (Titania to Earth departure, plasmoid encounter).

## EP04 IF Scenarios

1. **What if the engine was used to evade the plasmoid?**
   - Costs 1 ignition from the 3-4 budget
   - Saves 480 mSv radiation exposure
   - But cascading effect: extra thermal cycle damages nozzle
   - EP05's 26-minute nozzle margin would disappear → mission failure

2. **What if きりたん had stayed at Titania?**
   - Physically safe but captured by security fleet (33h)
   - Narrative choice: freedom vs survival
