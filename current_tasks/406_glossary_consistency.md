# Task 406: Standardize Glossary Term Definitions Across Episodes

## Status: **DONE**

## Summary

Glossary terms like "磁気ノズル" have inconsistent definitions across episodes. Audit all shared glossary terms and standardize to the most complete/accurate version.

## Rationale
- Glossaries are visible to all readers — inconsistency confuses
- EP05's more detailed definitions reflect latest corrections work
- Cross-episode consistency is a CLAUDE.md principle
