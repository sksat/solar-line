# Task 191: EP03 Counterfactual IF Analyses

Status: DONE

## Goal

Add counterfactual IF analyses to EP03 (Enceladus → Titania, 143h transit).
EP03 has 3 explorations but zero IF decision-fork analyses.

## EP03 IF Scenarios

1. **What if the navigation error had not been caught (or caught later)?**
   - EP03's crisis: 99.8% accuracy navigation, 0.2% error = miss
   - IF: What if the crew missed the error by 1 hour? 5 hours?
   - How much ΔV would a late course correction cost?

2. **What if a different Uranus moon was targeted instead of Titania?**
   - Similar to EP02's IF analysis (different Saturn moon capture)
   - Compare Titania vs Oberon vs Ariel vs Miranda capture ΔV
