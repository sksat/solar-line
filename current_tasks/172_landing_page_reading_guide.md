# Task 172: Landing Page Redesign — Reading Guide & Navigation Flow

Status: DONE

## Goal
Redesign the landing page to help first-time readers understand what the site offers, how to navigate it, and what the key findings are — following Codex's "clearer trust + clearer story" recommendation.

## Background
Codex consultation (2026-02-25): "biggest opportunity is not more physics, it's clearer trust + clearer story." The landing page is currently functional but doesn't guide readers or present the narrative arc. A new reader landing on the page doesn't know:
- What order to read reports in
- What the overall findings are ("is the anime accurate?")
- What makes this analysis trustworthy
- How deep they can go

## Changes
1. **30-second summary ("この考証の結論")** — One paragraph answering "is SOLAR LINE's orbital mechanics accurate?" with key stats
2. **Reading guide section ("はじめに読む")** — Recommended reading paths for different reader types:
   - SF anime fan: Episode reports in order (EP1→EP5)
   - Orbital mechanics enthusiast: Ship specs → Cross-episode → Specific transfers
   - Quick overview: This page + Cross-episode summary
3. **Key findings highlights** — 3-4 most interesting/surprising findings with links
4. **Prev/next navigation on episode pages** — Add episode navigation strip
5. **Per-page "3-line conclusion"** — Brief summary at top of each episode report

## Scope for this task
Focus on items 1-3 (landing page content). Items 4-5 are separate tasks (navigation flow).
