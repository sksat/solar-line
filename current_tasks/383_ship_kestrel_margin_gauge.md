# Task 383: Ship Kestrel ギリギリ一覧 Margin Gauge

## Status: **DONE**

## Summary

The ship-kestrel report has a "ギリギリ一覧" section listing 7 critical margins across all episodes as prose bullet points. Add a margin-gauge component to visualize actual vs limit values at a glance.

## Rationale
- CLAUDE.md: margin visualization, gauge/bar charts for limit proximity
- The data is already in the report text, just needs visual treatment
