# Task 176: Narrative Plausibility Review

## Status: TODO

## Description

Beyond physics validation and cross-episode consistency, check whether computed values (durations, distances, conditions) match the viewer's experience of the story. If an analysis produces a result that feels inconsistent with on-screen depiction, flag this as a narrative plausibility concern and explore alternative interpretations.

Focus areas:
- Do computed travel times match the pacing shown on screen?
- Are the "ギリギリ" moments truly tight margins, or do the numbers tell a different story?
- Does the cold sleep constraint (no cold sleep unless explicitly depicted) create any timeline concerns?
- Are there any scenes where the G-forces implied by our calculations would be noticeable but aren't shown?

## Dependencies

- All episode analyses complete
- Cross-episode consistency (Task 021)
