# Task 329: Communication Delay Timeline Chart

## Status: DONE

## Description
Add a communication delay timeline chart to the communications summary report using the `timeseries` MDX directive and uPlot. The report has extensive textual analysis of communication delays but no charts. CLAUDE.md says "Concrete values need visualization" and "More figures are better than fewer."

## Deliverables
- Time-series chart showing Earth communication delay (minutes) over the entire ~124-day mission
- Communication zone bands (real-time, near-real-time, delayed, deep-space)
- Episode boundary markers
- TDD tests validating chart presence in the report
