# Task 167: ADR for 考察 vs 考証 Naming Decision

Status: DONE

## Result
- Created ADR-015 with Proposed status
- 3 options documented: A) 考証 (recommended), B) 使い分け, C) 現状維持
- ADR README index updated
- Awaiting project owner decision

## Goal
Create a Proposed-status ADR for the naming decision: should the project be called "考察" (speculative analysis) or "考証" (evidence-based verification)?

## Background
Human directive: 「これ、考察というよりは考証か？」
See `ideas/naming_kousatsu_vs_koushou.md` for analysis.

## Approach
- Create ADR-015 with Proposed status (per CLAUDE.md: owner approval needed for user-facing changes)
- Document three options with trade-offs
- Do NOT change site title without explicit owner confirmation
