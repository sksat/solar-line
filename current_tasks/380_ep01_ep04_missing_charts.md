# Task 380: EP01 + EP04 Thrust Profile Charts

## Status: **DONE**

## Summary

EP02, EP03, EP05 all have thrust profile charts (推力 vs 時間). EP01 and EP04 are missing them:

| Episode | Velocity Profile | Thrust Profile |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| EP01    | YES | **MISSING** |
| EP02    | YES | YES |
| EP03    | YES | YES |
| EP04    | YES (thrust comparison) | **MISSING** (velocity comparison exists) |
| EP05    | YES | YES |

## Plan

1. Add brachistochrone thrust profile chart to EP01 (Mars→Ganymede 72h, 9.8 MN)
2. Add thrust profile chart to EP04 (Uranus→Earth, 65% = 6.37 MN)
