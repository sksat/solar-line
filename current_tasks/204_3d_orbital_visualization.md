# Task 204: 3D Orbital Analysis Visualization in Reports

## Status: NOT STARTED

## Objective
Render the existing 3D orbital analysis data (3d_orbital_analysis.json) as visual diagrams in episode reports. Currently the data exists but is not visualized.

## Scope
- Saturn ring plane crossing angle (26.8°) diagram for EP02
- Uranus axial tilt approach geometry (69°) diagram for EP04
- Out-of-plane distance annotations on orbital diagrams
- Interactive 3D perspective toggle where appropriate

## References
- reports/data/calculations/3d_orbital_analysis.json (existing data)
- Task 098 remaining work items
