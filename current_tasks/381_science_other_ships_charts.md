# Task 381: Science Accuracy + Other Ships Additional Charts

## Status: **DONE**

## Summary

1. Add log-scale bar chart to `science-accuracy.md` showing Hohmann→Brachistochrone time reduction factors (376x to 1,674x across 5 episodes)
2. Add ΔV capability bar chart to `other-ships.md` comparing estimated ΔV across vessel types

## Rationale
- "Diagrams and graphs for clarity" — CLAUDE.md directive
- The 短縮倍率 values (376x-1674x) are the most impressive numbers in the report, buried in a table
- The other-ships ΔV comparison table would be more intuitive as a bar chart
