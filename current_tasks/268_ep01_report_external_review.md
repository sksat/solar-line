# Task 268: EP01 Report External Review

## Status: DONE

## Priority: HIGH

## Objective
Conduct an external agent review of the EP01 episode report. The last focused review was Task 196 (~70+ tasks ago), before the epoch fix (Task 264), MDX migration (Task 186), and numerous content updates.

## Review Scope
- Data integrity: do cited values match calculation outputs?
- Analytical logic: are conclusions well-supported?
- Japanese text quality: natural phrasing, no awkward AI-generated text
- Epoch consistency: dates should reflect the 2214-10-27 epoch (Task 264)
- Cross-reference consistency with cross-episode and ship-kestrel reports
- Reader accessibility: can someone unfamiliar with SOLAR LINE follow the analysis?

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] External agent review completed
- [ ] Issues identified and fixed
- [ ] Tests pass after fixes
