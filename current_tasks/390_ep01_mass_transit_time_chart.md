# Task 390: EP01 Mass vs Transit Time Bar Chart

## Status: **DONE**

## Summary

EP01-exploration-01 compares 5 mass scenarios (48t to 48,000t) and their minimum transit times at 9.8 MN thrust. Only ≤299t achieves the 72-hour depicted timeline. EP01 has no bar charts. Add a log-scale bar chart showing transit time at each mass, with 72h threshold.

## Rationale
- CLAUDE.md: "Diagrams and graphs for clarity"
- EP01 is the only episode without a bar chart
- This is THE foundational analysis establishing the 48,000t mass mystery
- Log scale needed: 29h (48t) to 912h (48,000t)
