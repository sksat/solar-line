# Task 138: Project Health — DAG Cleanup, Science Accuracy Report, Quality Review

## Status: DONE

## Motivation
All 137 previous tasks are complete. This session focuses on project maintenance:
1. Generate and commit the science-accuracy.json summary report (was generated but never committed)
2. Clean up DAG state — many completed tasks/analyses still marked "pending"
3. Run report quality review to identify any remaining issues
4. Fix issues found

## Scope
- Science-accuracy report generation + commit
- DAG node status updates (pending → valid for completed items)
- Quality review of published reports
- Fix any issues surfaced by review
