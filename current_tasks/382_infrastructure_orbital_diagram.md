# Task 382: Infrastructure Orbital Diagram

## Status: **DONE**

## Summary

Add a solar-system-wide orbital diagram to `infrastructure.md` showing:
- Station locations (Mars, Ganymede, Enceladus, Titania) along Kestrel's route
- Inner sphere / outer sphere governance boundary
- Kestrel's route as transfer arcs
- Staffing annotations

Currently infrastructure.md has two bar charts but no spatial diagram. The cross-episode full-route-diagram doesn't cover stations or governance zones.

## Rationale
- CLAUDE.md: "Prioritize visual explanations"
- Infrastructure report analyzes spatial distribution of stations and governance, but has no map
- Existing orbital-diagram component supports this without code changes
