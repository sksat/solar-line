# Task 177: Relativistic Effects Assessment

## Status: DONE

## Description

At velocities reaching ~1% of the speed of light (e.g., EP05 brachistochrone peak velocity ~7,604 km/s = 2.5%c for 300t scenario), assess whether special relativistic effects are significant enough to affect the orbital transfer analyses.

Areas to investigate:
- Time dilation: how much proper time differs from coordinate time at 1-3%c
- Relativistic momentum: how much effective mass increase at 1-3%c affects thrust calculations
- Relativistic velocity addition: whether Newtonian velocity addition errors matter
- Lorentz factor (γ) at relevant velocities: quantify the correction magnitude
- Impact on existing verdicts: would any "plausible" verdict change to "implausible" (or vice versa) with relativistic corrections?

Human directive: 光速の1%レベルの速度に到達する場合、厳密には相対論効果も考える必要があるのだろうか？

## Expected outcome

A brief analysis (could be a new exploration or a section in cross-episode summary) quantifying relativistic corrections at the relevant velocity range and concluding whether they're material to the analysis.

## Dependencies

- EP05 analysis (Task 023, DONE)
- Cross-episode consistency (Task 021, DONE)
