# Task 162: EP01 Jupiter-Centric Ganymede Approach Diagram + Full-Route Leg Highlighting

## Status: DONE

## Goal
1. Add a Jupiter-centric Ganymede approach diagram to EP01 (it's the only episode missing a local system diagram)
2. Add interactive leg highlighting to the full-route diagram (hover/click to focus on individual transfer legs)

## Context
- EP02 has Jupiter-centric (escape) and Saturn-centric (Enceladus capture) diagrams
- EP03 has Uranus-centric (Titania approach) diagram
- EP04 has Uranus-centric (Titania departure) diagram
- EP05 has Earth-centric (LEO capture) and Uranus-centric (departure) diagrams
- **EP01 is missing** a Jupiter-centric Ganymede arrival diagram

## Scope

### Part 1: EP01 Ganymede Approach Diagram
- Jupiter-centric, showing Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto)
- Brachistochrone approach arc from interplanetary space to Ganymede
- Description explaining this is the arrival phase of the 72h Mars→Jupiter transfer

### Part 2: Full-Route Diagram Leg Highlighting
- Hover/click on a transfer leg in the full-route diagram to highlight it
- Mute (reduce opacity) other transfer arcs and non-relevant orbits
- Show episode label/info for the highlighted leg
- Tie to episode link (click to navigate to episode analysis)
