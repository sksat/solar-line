# Task 273: Cross-Episode Summary Report External Review

## Status: DONE

## Objective
External agent review of the cross-episode summary report (cross-episode.md) — the main analytical summary tying all 5 episodes together.

## Approach
Following the same pattern as Tasks 268-272 (episode external reviews):
1. Launch an external agent (separate context) to review the report
2. Reviewer persona: SF/orbital mechanics enthusiast, NOT deeply familiar, no prior SOLAR LINE knowledge
3. Check data integrity, analytical logic, readability, Japanese text quality
4. Fix issues found in the review

## Success Criteria
- External agent review completed
- All significant issues identified and fixed
- Tests still pass after fixes
