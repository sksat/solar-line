# Task 386: Cross-Episode Mass Boundary Convergence Chart

## Status: **DONE**

## Summary

Add a bar chart to cross-episode.md showing how effective mass boundaries converge across episodes:
- EP01: ≤299t
- EP03: ≤452.5t
- EP04: ≤3,929t (at 65% thrust)
- EP05: ≤300t

Compared against 48,000t nominal — the "mass mystery" is the project's key unresolved finding.

## Rationale
- CLAUDE.md: "Diagrams and graphs for clarity" — the 48,000t vs ~300t gap is the project's biggest finding
- Data exists in prose/tables but no dedicated visualization
- Makes the mass convergence pattern immediately visible
