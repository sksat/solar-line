# Task 387: EP03 Burn Sequence ΔV Bar Chart

## Status: **DONE**

## Summary

EP03 has a 6-phase burn sequence reconstruction (Saturn escape → cruise → RCS corrections → Uranus capture) with ΔV values spanning 0.04 to 2,990 km/s. This is currently only in a prose table. Add a log-scale bar chart to make the 47% ΔV saving over pure brachistochrone visually obvious.

## Rationale
- CLAUDE.md: "Diagrams and graphs for clarity"
- EP03's burn reconstruction is a unique analysis finding, buried in text
- Log scale needed to show 0.04 km/s RCS alongside 2,990 km/s main burns
