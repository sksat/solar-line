# Task 091: Narrative Plausibility Review Process

## Status: TODO

## Motivation

Human directive:
- 作品の描写からして、年単位の航行は違和感がある
- このような違和感を発見できるレビューを行うようにしたい

## Context

The EP02 ballistic transfer of ~455 days feels inconsistent with the show's pacing and depiction. While physically valid, the year-long voyage may not match what's shown on screen. This type of "narrative plausibility" check is different from physics validation — it's about whether our analysis matches the viewer's experience of the story.

## Scope

### Phase 1: EP02 455-day review
- Re-examine EP02 ballistic transfer duration
- Check if the show explicitly states or implies a shorter timeframe
- Consider alternative interpretations (partial thrust, different trajectory)
- Document findings

### Phase 2: Establish review process
- Create a review checklist that includes:
  - Physics plausibility ✅ (existing)
  - Narrative consistency ✅ (existing — cross-episode)
  - **Viewer experience plausibility** 🆕 (does our analysis match what the show depicts?)
- Add to report-review skill
- Identify any other analyses where computed values feel inconsistent with depiction

### Phase 3: Systematic review
- Apply the narrative plausibility check to all 24 transfer analyses
- Flag any where computed duration/distance/conditions seem at odds with on-screen depiction
- Discuss discrepancies in reports

## Dependencies
- Episode analyses (Tasks 006, 008, 015, 020, 023 — all DONE)
- Report review skill (Task 057 — DONE)
