# Task 262: Tech Overview Stats Refresh

## Status: IN_PROGRESS

## Priority: LOW

## Objective
Update stale statistics in tech-overview.md and ai-costs.md reports. After Task 261 added 9 E2E tests (propagation demo), the counts are outdated:
- E2E: 205 → 214
- Total tests: 2,611 → 2,620
- Also check commit count, task count, and other stats for freshness

## Scope
1. Update tech-overview.md test counts
2. Update ai-costs.md stats if stale
3. Verify article content validation tests still pass
4. Commit all changes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test counts in tech-overview.md are accurate
- [ ] Stats in ai-costs.md are current
- [ ] All existing tests pass
