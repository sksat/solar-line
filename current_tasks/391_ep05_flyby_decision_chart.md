# Task 391: EP05 Jupiter Flyby IF Analysis Bar Chart

## Status: **DONE**

## Summary

EP05-exploration-06 shows the series' climactic IF analysis: with Jupiter flyby burn time = 55h12m (26min margin vs 55h38m nozzle), without = 56h51m (73min over limit → nozzle destroyed → can't stop). EP05 has no bar charts. Add a chart comparing burn times against nozzle limit.

## Rationale
- CLAUDE.md: "Margin visualization" and "counterfactual analysis"
- EP05 is the only remaining episode without a bar chart
- This is the series' climactic "ギリギリ" — 0.78% nozzle margin
- Visualizes why Jupiter flyby was mandatory, not optional
