# Task 232: Other-Ships Orbital Diagrams (EP02 + EP05)

## Status: DONE

## Goal

Add orbital diagrams to the other-ships summary report for:
1. EP02 large ship ambush at Saturn/Enceladus (Saturn-centric)
2. EP05 security boats at Jupiter flyby intercept (heliocentric)

## Motivation

- The other-ships report has only one orbital diagram (EP04 fleet)
- EP02 and EP05 ship encounters have detailed analysis text but no visualization
- CLAUDE.md: "Diagrams and graphs for clarity: Prioritize visual explanations"
- MEMORY.md lists "other-ships orbital diagrams" as a potential next task

## Changes

1. Add Saturn-centric diagram for EP02 large ship ambush (Enceladus orbit context)
2. Add heliocentric diagram for EP05 security boats at Jupiter intercept
3. Add article content tests for new diagrams
