# Task 401: Fix Character Name Inconsistency (セイラ・アンダース)

## Status: **DONE**

## Summary

EP03 uses "セイラ・アンダース" (confirmed from visual nameplate) but EP05 uses "弁務官セイランダース" (ASR artifact). Standardize to the visually confirmed EP03 form across all files.

## Rationale
- CLAUDE.md: "Transcription-report sync" — speaker names must be consistent
- Reader confusion when same character has different names across episodes
