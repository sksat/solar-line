# Task 269: EP02 Report External Review

## Status: DONE

## Priority: HIGH

## Objective
Conduct an external agent review of the EP02 episode report. EP02 covers Jupiter escape → Saturn/Enceladus with the critical trim-thrust transit (3-day thrust, ~87-day coast). This episode has the most complex orbital mechanics and the largest time contribution (~70%) to the total mission.

## Review Scope
- Data integrity: do cited values match calculation outputs?
- Analytical logic: are conclusions well-supported?
- Epoch consistency: dates should use the 2214 epoch
- Cross-reference consistency with cross-episode and ship-kestrel reports
- Reader accessibility
- The trim-thrust correction (455d → 87d) was a major fix — verify all references are updated

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] External agent review completed
- [ ] Issues identified and fixed
- [ ] Tests pass after fixes
