# Task 253: Fix Orbital Diagram Partial Celestial Body Motion

## Status: TODO

## Description

Human directive: In orbital transfer diagrams, some celestial bodies move during animation while others remain static. This looks unnatural. All bodies in a diagram should either all move (at their correct orbital velocities) or the animation should make the motion model clear.

Use TDD approach: write failing tests first, then fix the animation code.
