# Task 008: Episode 2 Content Analysis

## Status: TODO

## Goal
Analyze orbital transfers depicted in Episode 2 of SOLAR LINE. Identify ΔV claims, evaluate plausibility, and generate report.

## Depends on
- Task 002 (orbital mechanics library)
- Task 005 (report pipeline)
- Task 006 (Episode 1 analysis — as template)

## Scope
1. Research Episode 2 source material (Niconico/YouTube)
2. Extract ship specs, route details, transfer parameters
3. Analyze plausibility of depicted transfers
4. Generate ep02.json report
5. Create session log

## Notes
- Follow the same methodology as Task 006
- May need to extend orbital.ts with new constants depending on destinations
