# Task 087: 他の宇宙船・係留地の分析

## Status: TODO

## Motivation

Human directive: 「主人公とは別の宇宙船や係留地などについても分析したい」

## Scope

Expand the analysis beyond Kestrel to include:
- Other spacecraft depicted in the series (cargo ships, patrol vessels, etc.)
- Mooring stations and orbital infrastructure (fuel depots, relay stations)
- Port facilities and their orbital parameters

## Approach

1. Review all 5 episodes for mentions/depictions of non-Kestrel objects
2. Catalog orbital parameters, sizes, capabilities where available
3. Analyze their orbital mechanics (station-keeping, transfer windows, etc.)
4. Add findings to episode reports and/or new summary report
