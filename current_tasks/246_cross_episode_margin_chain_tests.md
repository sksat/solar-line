# Task 246: Cross-Episode Margin Chain Content Validation

## Status: DONE

## Description

Added article content validation tests for the cross-episode report's margin chain analysis — the project's core analytical finding. These values represent key conclusions that should not silently drift.

## Tests Added (7)

- ✅ Margin chain probability: 30-46% cited
- ✅ Coupling mechanisms: Jacobian sensitivity analysis
- ✅ Navigation precision evolution: EP03→EP05, 290万倍 improvement
- ✅ EP05 arrival precision: 20 km at 18.2 AU
- ✅ Cumulative radiation: 560 mSv vs 600 mSv limit
- ✅ Counterfactual ΔV: all 4 alternatives compared (5,424 / 12,912 / 18,893 / 36,071)
- ✅ EP02 timeline dominance: ~78%

## Stats
- TS tests: 1,946 → 1,953 (+7)
- All 2,502 tests pass (0 failures)
