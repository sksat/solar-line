# Task 202: Plasmoid Perturbation Trajectory Analysis

## Status: NOT STARTED

## Objective
Estimate trajectory perturbations from plasmoid encounters in EP04, distinguishing radiation effects from momentum effects. Currently only radiation dose (480 mSv) is analyzed.

## Scope
1. Model plasmoid as charged particle cloud
2. Estimate momentum transfer and trajectory deflection
3. Calculate correction ΔV required
4. Distinguish radiation vs momentum perturbation effects
5. Add analysis section to EP04 report
