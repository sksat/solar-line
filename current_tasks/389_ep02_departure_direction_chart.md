# Task 389: EP02 Jupiter Departure Direction Bar Chart

## Status: **DONE**

## Summary

EP02-exploration-01 compares Jupiter departure directions (prograde 18.99 km/s, retrograde 7.12 km/s, 45° 17.25 km/s) against solar escape velocity 18.46 km/s. Only prograde reaches Saturn. EP02 has 0 bar charts despite rich numerical data. Add a bar chart showing this critical direction dependence with threshold line.

## Rationale
- CLAUDE.md: "Diagrams and graphs for clarity"
- EP02 has no bar charts (only timeseries + diagrams + margin-gauge)
- Departure direction is the episode's key orbital mechanics finding
