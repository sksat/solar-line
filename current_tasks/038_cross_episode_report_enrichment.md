# Task 038: Enrich Earlier Reports with Later Episode Findings

## Status: TODO

## Motivation
Human directive: "後の話や後の話の解析から明らかになった事実も、解析に使えるデータないし文脈として既存レポートを追記・清書してよい"

Currently each episode report is written mostly in isolation. But findings from later episodes can inform earlier analyses. For example:
- EP04-05 mass boundary constraints can be cross-referenced with EP01's mass analysis
- EP03's navigation precision can validate EP01-02 trajectory assumptions
- EP05's final route data gives total ΔV budget context for all earlier transfers

## Scope
1. Review each episode report for opportunities to add cross-episode context
2. Add references to later findings where they strengthen or nuance earlier analysis
3. Ensure consistency of parameters and assumptions across all reports
4. Clean up and polish existing report text where needed

## Depends on
- All episode analyses (ep01-ep05)
- Task 037 (planetary positions may affect report content)
