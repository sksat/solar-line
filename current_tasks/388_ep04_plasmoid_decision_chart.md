# Task 388: EP04 Plasmoid Decision IF Analysis Bar Chart

## Status: **DONE**

## Summary

EP04's plasmoid decision is the most dramatic IF analysis in the project: "480 mSv被曝 or 帰還不能". The exploration-04 block has detailed scenario comparison but no visualization. Add a bar chart comparing the two paths' key outcomes (radiation, burn count, nozzle margin, EP05 result).

## Rationale
- CLAUDE.md: "Margin visualization" and "counterfactual analysis" directives
- The decision tree is the episode's most important causal chain
- Currently only in JSON exploration block, no visual summary
