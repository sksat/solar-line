# Task 010: Localize Reports to Japanese

## Status: TODO

## Goal
Convert all GitHub Pages report templates and existing report data to Japanese (日本語).

## Depends on
- Task 005 (report pipeline)
- Task 006 (Episode 1 analysis — existing report to convert)

## Scope
1. Update `ts/src/templates.ts` — all UI text, headings, labels in Japanese
2. Update `reports/data/episodes/ep01.json` — analysis text, findings, assumptions in Japanese
3. Verify build output renders correctly with Japanese text
4. Future reports (ep02+) should be written in Japanese from the start

## Notes
- This is a directive from the project owner
- Reflected in CLAUDE.md under "Reports" section
