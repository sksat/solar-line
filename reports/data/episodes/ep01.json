The Kestrel's stated thrust of 9.8 MN on 48,000t mass provides only ~0.204 m/s² (~0.02g) — roughly 160x too weak. Even with continuous burn for the full 72 hours, the ship's ΔV budget is only ~52.9 km/s, which is ~160x less than the ~8,497 km/s needed. The reachable distance in 72h with stated thrust is only ~3.4M km (~0.023 AU), far short of the ~3.68 AU required. Note: this analysis is optimistic since it ignores solar gravity, which is dominant at these thrust levels.",

The 150h route is less extreme than 72h but still requires propulsion far beyond the stated engine specifications. The worldbuilding is internally consistent (72h is 'extreme' vs 150h 'normal'), but both timeframes require thrust-to-weight ratios the Kestrel's stated specs cannot provide.",

This is substantial for real-world spacecraft but insufficient for the depicted 72h interplanetary transfer by ~2 orders of magnitude. The discrepancy may indicate: (1) the 48,000t mass is a translation/notation issue, (2) the fusion drive operates differently than constant-thrust, (3) the setting includes unstated physics (gravitational assists, space infrastructure, pre-acceleration), or (4) the dramatic scenario prioritizes narrative over strict physical accuracy. Without exhaust velocity/Isp data, we cannot determine propellant fraction or true ΔV budget via the Tsiolkovsky equation.",
