# Session Log: Episode 1 Analysis (2026-02-23)

## Goal
First end-to-end analysis: identify orbital transfer descriptions in Episode 1, extract ΔV claims, and evaluate plausibility.

## Research Phase

### Source Material
- **SOLAR LINE Part 1** (sm45280425, Niconico): 19:20, uploaded 2025-08-11
- **Description**: 小型船貨物船を操るきりたんが，火星から木星圏のガニメデまでとある貨物を輸送します
- **Worldbuilding document**: note.com/yuepicos/n/n4da939fc40ed ("ソーラーラインのよもやま話")

### Key Findings from Source Material

**Ship: Kestrel (ケストレル)**
- Registration: MPA-MC-SCV-02814
- Classification: Small Cargo Vessel, 42.8m length
- Maximum mass: ~48,000 t (standard load)
- Engine: TSF-43R "Orion Micropulser" (D-He³ fusion pulse)
- Normal thrust: 9.8 MN, Peak: 10.7 MN
- Ship power: 7.2 MW

**Contract (from in-episode display)**
- Route: Mars Marineris Central Port → Ganymede Central Port
- Deadline: T+72:00:00 (72 hours)
- Normal route time: ~150 hours
- Cargo: 2 sealed containers, 42.3 t, Trim Index 0.64
- Priority Code: PRT-ALPHA-72-FASTPASS
- Uses "Storm Corridor" (嵐の回廊) through Jupiter's radiation belts

**Navigation Display Data**
- Expected thrust: 9.6 MN @ 100% output
- Radiation: 2.8 Sv/h ship exterior
- Magnetic shield life: 41 minutes (major constraint)

## Analysis

### Codex Consultation
Consulted Codex on methodology. Key advice:
- Use brachistochrone as sanity bound, note that solar gravity (~2.5e-3 m/s²) is ~12x ship acceleration near Mars
- Analyze multiple Mars-Jupiter distance geometries (3.68, 5.42, 6.73 AU)
- Frame 150h and 72h as both being "high-energy transfer regimes" far beyond Hohmann
- Ship thrust/mass ratio gives only ~0.02g — 5 orders of magnitude gap noted

### Transfer Analyses Computed

1. **Hohmann baseline**: 10.15 km/s total ΔV, 1,127 days — impossibly slow for this setting
2. **72h brachistochrone (closest)**: Needs 32.8 m/s² (3.3g), 8,497 km/s ΔV — ship provides 0.2 m/s²
3. **150h normal route (closest)**: Needs 7.55 m/s² (0.77g), 4,079 km/s ΔV — still 37x too much
4. **Ship capability**: 0.204 m/s², max ΔV ~52.9 km/s in 72h continuous burn, reaches ~0.023 AU

### Verdict
The 72-hour Mars→Ganymede transfer is **implausible** with the stated ship specifications (48,000t, 9.8 MN). The gap is ~2 orders of magnitude in thrust-to-weight ratio. However, the worldbuilding is *internally consistent* in that 72h is presented as extreme/dangerous vs the "normal" 150h. The discrepancy likely stems from one of:
1. The mass specification (48,000 t for a 42.8m ship is remarkably dense)
2. Unstated physics or infrastructure in the setting
3. Narrative priority over strict accuracy

## Implementation
- Extended `orbital.ts` with Jupiter constants, `orbitalPeriod`, `brachistochroneAccel/DeltaV`
- Created `ep01-analysis.ts` with full analysis module
- Created `ep01-analysis.test.ts` with 29 passing tests
- Created episode report JSON at `reports/data/episodes/ep01.json`
